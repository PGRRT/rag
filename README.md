#### Pre-commit
Pre commit is used to automatically run linters, formatters and ensures that all tests are passing

1.Install **pre-commit** command with  ``` pip install pre-commit ```.\
2. run ```pre-commit install``` to install git hooks.\
3. install **pytest** with ```pip install pytest``` for python test. If it is not installed, python tests will not run.\
4. The hooks will run automatically after each commit. Or you can run them manually with ```pre-commit run --all-files```.
